		<p class="salutation">Hello Eagle Scout and Family, </p>
		<p>
			Creating a program for your Eagle Scout Court of Honor can seem like an insurmountable task. Iâ€™m here to help you create something beautiful and memorable to remember your teen life in scouting.  
		</p>
		<p class="blockquote">
			You must start creating your program at least 3 to 4 weeks before your COH date. I will need a couple weeks to work with you to refine the program (it usually takes 6 or 7 iterations until it's done. The print shop must have at least 3 - 5 business days to print, fold and staple the programs. 
		</p>

		<h3>It's All Up To You</h3>
		<p>
			Each Eagle Scout writes up whatever stories they want to tell about their journey through scouting, their favorite events, their Eagle Project and whatever they want to talk about. You can show off which Merit Badges you've earned abd the leadership positions you've held. You can choose to show snapshots through your years in scouting.
		</p>
		<h3>Remote Editing</h3>
		<p>
			I usually handle everything over email and telephone, rarely using Facetime, Zoom or Discord for videoconferencing. I will create a folder on OneDrive to share with you the current PDF of the program. Your job is to decide what's right, what's wrong and what you'd like to change.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Steps to Success</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>The Basics</strong>: Email me the Eagle Scout's name, spelled and presented as you'd like to see on the cover. Also send me the date of the court of honor and the location. You can change these later, but it tells me how much time we have to finish the program.

				<a href="/covers"><strong>Choose a cover</strong> for your program</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="/write">Decide what you want to write about</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Photos</strong>: Send me lots of pictures (in the highest resolution possible) and I'll figure out how to tell the story. OR point me at the Smugmug gallery that has the photos of your Eagle project and let me choose. Note that I edit the photos so that faces are recognizable and the photo tells a story: I will ask if you want to put a caption under the photo as well.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Leadership</strong>: Decide how much of your leadership and merit badges you want to show. If you want to show it all, grab an Advancement Worksheet from the above folder and fill it out.
